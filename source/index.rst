Privacy to the People
====================================

For a long time, society has used keys, combination codes, and other physical means to protect our property and secrets. This is one of the things we learn growing up, but in the digital age, it isn't always clear how to achieve the same level of privacy.

If you are not working to encrypt everything you do digitally, now is the time. The powers that be have access to everything you do and have done digitally, and whether your statements, thoughts, jokes and opinions are criminalizing or not, the can certainly be turned against you.


Why encrypt?
===================================

Not encrypting is the equivalent of leaving the door to your house unlocked when you go on vacation. If you wouldn't mind the general public seeing it, encrypt it.

Resources
===================================
Luckily there are quite a few apps and programs that make encryption straightforward, as well as built in encryption settings in a lot of the smartphones and operating systems in circulation.


SMS
====================================
**Signal Private Messenger**

Android Phone
===================================

Encrypting your phone has some benefits. Without encryption, someone could turn on your phone, plug it into a computer, and download all your photos and files with no password. With encryption, you have to enter a password to even turn your phone on and access the files.

Beware that this is a 1-way process. Once you encrypt your phone, you'll have to do a full reset if you want to turn encryption off in the future.

* Go to Settings
* Scroll down and choose Security
* Scroll down and find Encryption
* Choose "Encrypt phone"
* Follow the instructions on screen
* Wait a while.... And then your phone will be encrypted.
